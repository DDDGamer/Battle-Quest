# Installation
Pre req: have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed

* Clone `git clone` - downloads code onto your local machine
* run `npm install` - installs any node dependencies
* run `npm build` - transpiles/converts from typescript to javascript as you edit the `.ts` files
* Do NOT edit the `.js` files in the `script` folder directly, as its generated from the `ts` folder and its files.
